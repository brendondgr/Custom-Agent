# Custom-Agent
## Description
A work-in-progress agent for my personal use.
## Goals
The purpose of this is to create my own custom Agent by employing LangChain, Speech-To-Text, Text-To-Speech, and other Model Trainings to potentially create an Agentic AI that can do tasks automatically for you or with the use of your voice.

Currently Plan is as Follows:
1. Create a Quick-and-Easy system for voice activation of agent. This will involve listening to a specific Microphone/Virtual CABLE on the system.
2. Have a specific list of commands that can be utilized to do tasks quick and easy for myself/the user.
3. Have the computations done automatically in the background, with a Text-To-Speech model that the user can train themselves, or possibly one that is automatically trained for the user.
4. Output the information in a clear format for the user.

This is just a general outline, specifics will be written in "Ideas" as further plans are laid out for functions.

## Ideas
**Note**: All of the following will be done using voice commands.
1. Search Perplexity, ChatGPT, etc automatically via Web.
2. Get Weather for specific Zip-Code
3. Run Back-Ups for specific Files
4. Push Repositories for GitHub automatically.
5. Send Messages (Discord, Slack, etc).
